This repository contains projects that I've done in Deep learning Specialization courses to challenge my DeepLearning skills.

# Emojifier

- Description:

  In this project i've implemented a classifier which tries to suggest an emojie related to the sentence overal meaning.
  
  I've used Glove for Sentence to vector operation.
